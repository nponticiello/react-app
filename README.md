This blog post is just a few that I either dislike or am currently facing. Such as the new issues recent grads will face, how to deal with the cold, and why NFT's are just way over hyped. It will also contain a news bar that will refresh every several seconds. 

For this app we used react version 17.0.2, react-router-dom version 6.2.1, and axios version 0.24.0.

1) Go to github 
2) Press the "Code" button and download the zip file of the app. Then upzip the file. 
3) Move the file into the location where you would the app to be stored 
4) Open terminal/command prompt and change the directory to where the file is located
5) Then change the directory to the file
6) Run the following commands below in the exact order as shown below

npm install

npm install react

npm install react-router-dom 6.2.1

npm isntall axios

6) run npm start
7) If a window does not pop up automatically then please try and manually go to localhost:3000 in your browser







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
